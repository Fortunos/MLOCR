Optical Character Recognition of digits using machine learning.

We will be using the MNIST database of handwritten digits to make use of machine learning algorithms.

We currently have implementations of the following machine learning techniques:
1. Single Perceptron
2. Naive Bayes

In order to run the program, you'll need the [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which you should place in a directory called `mnist`.
